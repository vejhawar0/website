Hey, I'm Vedant, a senior studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at University of California, Berkeley. 

Here are some hobbies:
* PCB Design: As a consequence of joining the low voltage electrical team at [FEB](https://ev.studentorg.berkeley.edu), I've found myself doing a lot of PCB design to fulfill all sorts of functions. The low barrier of entry and ease of manufacturing have made it easy to create designs, regardless of whether or not I choose to manufacture them at the time. Right now, I'm attempting to design a custom mini drone using custom PCBs.
* Badminton: Having started back in high school, these days, I usually end up picking up my racket whenever I reasonably can. While certainly not at the level of a trained player, I can still reasonably put up a challenge with most amateur players.
* Programming: While I currently am not beyond the level of a university student in terms of experience and expertise in programming, I intend to remedy this in the coming months or years. I wish to use this blog as a way of both documenting my general projects and thoughts, as well as providing at least a fundamental education on some of the topics that I have found interesting.
