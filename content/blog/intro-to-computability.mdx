### Exposition
With the [proliferation of technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age) in an attempt to miniaturize computation devices, computers have ushered in a new era. On the consumer side, computers have taken over the fields of entertainment, knowledge-acquisition, and communication, empowering customers and boosting productivity. In particular, the barrier for developing larger scale programs has decreased dramatically, enabling more people to study and implement their own programs on computers.

Near the end of an introductory Data Structures and Algorithms course, you are introduced to the concept of P and NP. A quick resource highlighting the definitions can be found [here](https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~hussainu/decision_problem.html). Shortly afterwards, you are
