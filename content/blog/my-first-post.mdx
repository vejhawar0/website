description: Introduction on what the blog is about
---

**This post wasn't supposed to exist.** 

To be more precise, this post is a placeholder for what was supposed to be the real first post of the blog. Having just created the blog around a week ago, I figured that I'd do a weekly post in which I could research and introduce topics that I would be interested in. My attention was then directed towards computability, which was the topic of a class I had just completed in the semester prior. To be more precise, I was interested in creating a post describing why certain algorithms were not computable. I believed that it worked well for two reasons. The first was that the course content was relatively fresh in my mind, providing both an opportunity to present a relatively "correct" and intuitive explanation of computability while also vanquishing any doubts I myself had. The second was that the post would form a precedent of the kind of content both you, the viewer, and I could come to expect of the blog. It would be a benchmark that future posts would need to match or surpass in terms of quality. Granted, I wasn't entirely convinced if this first post would even contain the kind of quality I would deem praiseworthy. The hope was that as I continued posting, I would quite noticeably improve. With that, I began writing my supposed first blog post.

As you have probably guessed, things didn't exactly go according to plan. There were a few factors as to why, all related to the novelty of this blog. The first was quite simply that I didn't get a full seven days to work on the post. I was still setting up parts of the blog and figuring out what I would do with it, only coming up with the content shortly after. I certainly don't think that I needed the entire week, especially since each relevant detail was quite fresh in my head, but taking the extra time could only have helped. I spent between Wednesday and Saturday writing up a set of rather basic and uninformative notes on what I already knew. I mainly wanted to iron out a workflow for future topics I would have very little background in, however I do think that the time lost writing up these notes was more detrimental than beneficial. That being said, up until this evening, I was slightly optimistic that I could still pump out a post of lower quality that subsequent edits would improve (I know, I know. Why even have a deadline at that point?). It was here that I ran into my most irksome problem: I couldn't render any math through markdown on the post. I spent a few hours wrestling with integrating KaTex and ContentLayer into my workflow, resulting in either security vulnerabilities or stuff just not outright working. I admit that this is entirely due to my inexperience with NextJS and web development as a whole, but regardless, I most certainly was not going to finish the post by the deadline with any semblance of quality or critical thought. A little saddened, I began thinking of ways I could remediate this situation.

That brings us here. At this point, you wouldn't be remiss to ask what the point of this post even is. Why not just extend the "deadline" after fixing the math issue and have it be the first post in the blog *as it should have been*? I thought that I may as well use this opportunity to set up some ground rules for this blog. In a way, having this post be my first was likely a necessity. 

There are three purposes to this website. Firstly, it brings in a hypothetial audience. Under this scrutiny, I can't just scrounge up some low-effort content and call it a day. It forces me to consider an engaging topic, research it, and then present it in a way that is insightful or informative. It's more a form of pressure for myself to perform. In the future, I plan on including a method of contact for viewers to express their thoughts or criticisms. Secondly, it is a convenient and methodical way to explore topics that I've had an interest but have never gotten the chance to explore. I feel like this is pretty self-explanatory. Lastly, this website gives me the opportunity to give back to "the community". What is the community? Well, it's **you**, the audience. I want to reward those who have taken the time to navigate to my website and engage with my own thoughts. I feel that the best way to do so is by presenting my ideas in a clear, concise, and informative manner so that I can hopefully leave you with some food for thought. You might argue that my first and third point are exactly the same. I confess that they are similar, but distinct at the same time.

### Welcome to my Website. Thanks for Coming!!!

With that now all out of the way, I am excited to share with you that I am about to begin development on my newest project, which is just a miniature drone. While I still do want to eventually post [What is Computability](/blog/what-is-computability), I feel like I should dedicate the time once I have fully resolved the bugs in my front-end. I *believe* that this shouldn't take very long, but in the meantime will continue with the schedule that I have pre-arranged. This website technically still isn't published and I'm not too certain as to whether I'll include it once the website is posted. At the very least, I don't feel too bad about missing the deadline.
